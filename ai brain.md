MAPOLIS - AI BRAIN & SOURCE OF TRUTH
1. Project Overview
Name: Mapolis
Description: A feature-rich, interactive educational geography game.
Target Audience: Students and Educators.
Security & Compliance: VERY STRICT. Must adhere to COPPA and FERPA.
No third-party tracking (no Google Fonts, no external CDNs).
Strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
Handle sanitization (no real names, no profanity).
2. The Tech Stack
Frontend: Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (No frameworks like React).
Map Rendering: D3.js and TopoJSON.
Backend: Currently using localStorage. Preparing for Supabase backend integration (Phase B).
Assets: Self-hosted Base64 embedded assets for security.
3. Current Architecture & File Structure
(We are currently modularizing the massive index.html file into separate concerns)

4. AI Rules for Interaction
The User: Is not a coder, but is actively learning systems architecture.
The AI Must: Explain the "Why" (architecture/concept) and the "How" (the exact syntax) for every step.
Code Rules: Do NOT use HTML tags inside CSS files. Do not introduce third-party libraries without permission. Keep everything modular (Separation of Concerns).
5. Current Task / Where We Left Off
We just successfully moved the Base64 fonts out of index.html and into fonts.css.
We learned about Caching, Content Security Policy (CSP), and why HTML <style> tags don't belong in .css files.
